            <p>I got my driver's license last week<br>
            Just like we always talked about<br>
            'Cause you were so excited for me<br>
            To finally drive up to your house<br>
            But today I drove through the suburbs<br>
            Cryin' 'cause you weren't around<br><br>
            
            And you're probably with that blonde girl<br>
            Who always made me doubt<br>
            She's so much older than me<br>
            She's everything I'm insecure about<br>
            Yeah, today I drove through the suburbs<br>
            'Cause how could I ever love someone else?<br><br>
            
            And I know we weren't perfect but I've never felt this way for no one<br>
            And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone<br>
            Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me<br>
            'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street<br><br>
            
            And all my friends are tired<br>
            Of hearing how much I miss you, but<br>
            I kinda feel sorry for them<br>
            'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do, yeah<br>
            Today I drove through the suburbs<br>
            And pictured I was driving home to you<br><br>
            
            And I know we weren't perfect<br>
            But I've never felt this way for no one, oh<br>
            And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone<br>
            I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me<br>
            'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street
