            <p>I won't lie to you<br>
                I know he's just not right for you<br>
                And you can tell me if I'm off, but I see it on your face<br>
                When you say that he's the one that you want<br>
                And you're spendin' all your time in this wrong situation<br>
                And anytime you want it to stop<br><br>
                
                I know I can treat you better than he can<br>
                And any girl like you deserves a gentleman<br>
                Tell me, why are we wasting time on all your wasted cryin'<br>
                When you should be with me instead?<br>
                I know I can treat you better, better than he can<br><br>
                
                I'll stop time for you<br>
                The second you say you'd like me to<br>
                I just wanna give you the loving that you're missing<br>
                Baby, just to wake up with you<br>
                Would be everything I need, and this could be so different<br>
                Tell me what you want to do<br><br>
                
                'Cause I know I can treat you better than he can<br>
                And any girl like you deserves a gentleman<br>
                Tell me, why are we wasting time on all your wasted cryin'<br>
                When you should be with me instead?<br>
                I know I can treat you better, better than he can<br><br>
                
                Better than he can<br><br>
                
                Give me a sign, take my hand, we'll be fine<br>
                Promise I won't let you down<br>
                Just know that you don't have to do this alone<br>
                Promise I'll never let you down<br><br>
                
                'Cause I know I can treat you better than he can<br>

                When you should be with me instead?<br>
                I know I can treat you better, better than he can, oh<br><br>
