            <p>
                Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, yeah<br>
                Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do<br>
                Oh, yeah<br><br>
                
                Gotta change my answering machine<br>
                Now that I'm alone<br>
                'Cause right now it says that we can't come to the phone<br>
                And I know it makes no sense, 'cause you walked out the door<br>
                But it's the only way I hear your voice anymore<br><br>
                
                It's been months, and for some reason I just (can't get over us)<br>
                And I'm stronger than this, yeah (enough is enough)<br>
                No more walking around with my head down (yeah)<br>
                I'm so over being blue, crying over you<br><br>
                
                And I'm so sick of love songs, so tired of tears<br>
                So done with wishing you were still here<br>
                Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow<br>
                So, why can't I turn off the radio?<br><br>
                
                Gotta fix that calendar I have that's marked July 15th<br>
                'Cause since there's no more you, there's no more anniversary<br>
                I'm so fed up with my thoughts of you and your memory<br>
                And now every song reminds me of what used to be<br><br>
                
                That's the reason I'm so sick of love songs, so tired of tears<br>
                So done with wishing you were still here<br>
                Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow<br>
                So, why can't I turn off the radio?<br><br>
                
                Oh, (leave me alone) leave me alone<br>
                (Stupid love songs) oh-oh, hey<br>
                Don't make me think about her smile (ooh)<br>
                Or having my first child<br>
                I'm letting go<br>
                Turning off the radio
